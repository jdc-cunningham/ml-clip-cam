Super distracted today, want to leave by 3PM

The wind is perfect today

The code here is just recording but it has to use the touch screen interface (serial to serial messaging)

- [x] pi ready status
- [x] start record, respond to ESP32 display
- [x] stop save video
- [ ] record in 5 minute increments
  - did not do this, need separate timer thread

Ugh... this code is nasty, I don't have a clear plan/vision of what the code should be so I'm just writing stuff down

Also keep thinking about how I'm pressed for time

2:43 PM

Alright got the code working from boot

Had to put some time into the body/fix it after it fell off my hat ha

Prepping to go to the park now
