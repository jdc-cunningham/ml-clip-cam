- [ ] slow down sampling/refresh time
- [ ] see if "turning off" display reduces power consumption

Can verify with desk power supply

12:44 PM

Was suggested I reduce the CPU speed, was able to do that

Getting some power consumption figures

I will go from 240mhz to 10mhz

12:52 PM

So I did a power draw test and it peaks around 500mA but idle is 210mA at 5V

Oh I should sample it while it's recording

12:55 PM

Recording pulls a lot no surprise, somewhere around 470ma peaks beyond 500 and goes down to 455ma too
