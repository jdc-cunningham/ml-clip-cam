I did buy another v3 standard module, I have 3 now damn

I have to get the display programmable so I can modify it but unfortunately that is something I have to learn

I will focus on making a physical thing and programming later, it will be ugly but it has to work at the field on Tuesday 03/19/2024

Idk why but after work (10 hr shift) I have this miserable headache I can't shake

I thought it was food, dehydration... but yeah I'm just drained man...

At best I sleep by 11:30 PM, wake up 5:55 AM so 6.5 hrs of sleep

Then work for 10 hours until 5:30 PM come how... that's almost 12 hours of being up I guess

I'm supposed to be applying to jobs but I have not since I started the modular pi cam v2 project

New project already and still in work week

I have been getting the itch to fly though with spring

All of my footage up to now has been from a ground camera, so you see this little dot flying around in the sky

This one will be POV footage
