8:57 AM

Alright I actually got up early since I have a couple of things to do today

8 hrs sleep vs. 10 or 12 is not bad

Gonna print the test clip that is the base of the whole plastic body

Then the camera/swivel hinge thing

9:39 AM

Back on from brief break, print is at 80%

This is probably too big of an opening

Tomorrow's gonna be amazing

9:43 AM

Dang it has way too much give and too long

The length is based on how long the Pi Zero W is, I'll push it outwards

10:10 AM

Alright my schedule got pushed back so I will have more time to work on this

I have to fly before 3PM tomorrow that's when the lift will be strongest or after that

Have to assemble it, still don't know how to use the ESP32-based display

10:32 AM

3rd print on hat clip... it's nasty freehanded curves

11:27 AM

Ugh... my dunce brain... I was in a hurry to remove the back plate of my phone and I ripped the finger print cable in half... ughhhhh I've done this before but I was just on autopilot/not careful

Gotta wait another 3-4 days for a fully functional phone

12:16 PM

I finally have a phone again... was using a flip phone for a bit

So dumb... it just fell on my laptop edge (MBP) and it broke the screen lmao

12:43 PM

I'm laying out the parts... I'm trying not to make it too wide or too tall...

The daughter board that slides into the 40-pin female header will hold the round display... it should have a case all the way around it but I'm still unsure of the wiring at this time

1:02 PM

The cable blocks the hinge mechanism... so I'm still srewing around with that

I guess I'll do a split design where the cable is not blocked by a single hinge, will use 2

1:17 PM

I bought this lemon meringue pie from walmart ugh it sucks... I gotta eat it, no waste

1:26 PM

I have to avoid eating salty food until I donate plasma so my stage 2 hypertension doesn't disqualify me

That's right baby, I'm next in line

Alright let's go I have another hour before I have to do a call

OMG please... save me from poverty

I'm just thinking about that time I messed up my knee from a bull ride and had to pay $3K in cash for an MRI since my insurance was like "nah"

I still have that debt

1:32 PM

Yeah so it will look like this, trying to give it enough room for air flow

<img src="./devlog-images/stack.JPG"/>

I have to figure out what wires to use and how to power the thing... I already have some idea but I'll just leave room for that. The 2nd design will be more legit.

Today would have been a nice day if it was 25 degrees outside

Tomorrow almost hitting 70 F is nuts and convenient

The wind is not ideal... but I can deal with it

<img src="./devlog-images/wind.JPG"/>

Yeah... tomorrow's wind is not great

Red is ideal tomorrow is going from western winds to north western

The thermals get picked up from the field and then carried to where I am that diagonal green field area

2:20 PM

Ugh... this is the laziest design

<img src="./devlog-images/chunky.JPG"/>

Unfortunately it has a lot of parts mostly due to the large components eg. step up converter/bms

The clip is printed separately just because of how complicated this thing is (lots of supports already)

2:24 PM

How long will this print... can't be as bad as 10 hrs

<img src="./devlog-images/chasis.JPG"/>

2 hrs that's not bad, I'll print this while I'm gone

3:40 PM

Back from call/break

Ahh man... I gotta solder the parts, though would help to have this thing printed so I can gauge the length of the wires

I have to write the code that starts off in AP mode, turn it off (so can SSH, change)

5:00 PM

Alright early day from work loss of $35

make it count

5:41 PM

Damn I feel spent still, eyes hurt

Came up with a design and other purposes for this camera though

### 03/16/2024

7:20 PM

I did buy another v3 standard module, I have 3 now damn

I have to get the display programmable so I can modify it but unfortunately that is something I have to learn

I will focus on making a physical thing and programming later, it will be ugly but it has to work at the field on Tuesday 03/19/2024

8:07 PM

Idk why but after work (10 hr shift) I have this miserable headache I can't shake

I thought it was food, dehydration... but yeah I'm just drained man...

At best I sleep by 11:30 PM, wake up 5:55 AM so 6.5 hrs of sleep

Then work for 10 hours until 5:30 PM come how... that's almost 12 hours of being up I guess

I'm supposed to be applying to jobs but I have not since I started the modular pi cam v2 project

### 03/15/2024

10:06 PM

New project already and still in work week

I have been getting the itch to fly though with spring

All of my footage up to now has been from a ground camera, so you see this little dot flying around in the sky

This one will be POV footage
