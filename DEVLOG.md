Super distracted today, want to leave by 3PM

The wind is perfect today

The code here is just recording but it has to use the touch screen interface (serial to serial messaging)

- [ ] pi ready status
- [ ] start record, respond to ESP32 display
- [ ] stop save video
- [ ] record in 5 minute increments

Ugh... this code is nasty, I don't have a clear plan/vision of what the code should be so I'm just writing stuff down

Also keep thinking about how I'm pressed for time
